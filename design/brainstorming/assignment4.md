# Problem Statement

**Problem Domain: Fraternity Life**  
Being in a fraternity has played a great part in my social, academic, and personal development in college. I enjoy spending time with my fellow brothers through casual hangouts, supporting each other academically, and helping the fraternity grow by being involved with our inner logistics and formal events. Although not as involved as I used to be, I still like to help out whenever I can and offer my point of view as a senior by being a mentor to my underclassmen. Particularly, I would like for our organization to be more organized in many different aspects of how we run things and have members take more accountability and initiative.

**Problem: Staying Academically Connected to Brothers**  
This problem includes knowing which classes brothers are taking, which classes they have taken in the past and are knowledgeable in, as well as the specific schedule they have and academic extracurriculars they are a part of. This problem is often tackled by either having a spreadsheet at the beginning of the semester that brothers fill out or having multiple Slack messages of people asking “Who is taking X class?” This is often not very efficient as people’s schedules can drastically change after the first week, messages can get lost, or people may know a class another is taking but not the version or section they are in. Overall, this is an issue of disorganization that ends up in a lack of awareness and information available. I selected this problem because this is a genuine issue that I have dealt with as a scholarship chair in my fraternity and one in which every member in the fraternity could benefit from a solution. Its feasibility is also not out of reach, with similar problems (yet still different) being solved by applications like Hydrant and CourseRoad.

**Stakeholders**  
Brother (the user who shares their classes and views others’); Scholarship Chair (officer who keeps track of how brothers are doing in their classes and how they interact with each other academically); Professors/TAs (teach and administer the classes that brothers are taking); University/IFC (administrators who keep track of the academic performance of fraternities and students). **Impacts:** Brothers can perform better academically and feel more supported knowing which class their fellow members have taken and their proficiency in them. The Scholarship Chair is able to better keep track of brother academic performance and create plans for continued academic growth within the fraternity. Professors/TAs are interested in seeing better performance from their students and can have a reduced workload if students receive support from others taking the class. University/IFC can have a favorable outlook toward the fraternity, seeing that members take academic growth and performance seriously as part of a fraternity’s values.

**Evidence**

- **[Go Greek and See Grades Drop](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/01/07/study-grades-greek-affiliated-students-suffer-after-joining-fraternity-sorority):** This article highlights the fact that the grade average of students tends to drop after joining Greek life and explores the causes for this. This finding demonstrates that an organized academic support system within fraternities can have great benefits to all parties involved—brothers, fraternities, and the university itself.
- **[The Benefits of Friendships in Academic Settings: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis — PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10800095/):** The presence of friends and acquaintances in academic settings not only has a positive impact on grades, but also on the mental health of students. Additionally, a balance of social connections is necessary inside and outside of class, making organization of how to connect with friends academically in the proper manner extremely important.
- **[Group Project? Taking Turns, Working With Friends May Improve Grades | UW News](https://www.washington.edu/news/2017/09/25/group-project-taking-turns-working-with-friends-may-improve-grades/):** Not only do group activity and studying aid students in their class performance, but having balanced roles and good connections in said groups is also necessary. Not having people you properly connect with in group activities or collective studying can lead to negative impacts on students across many facets of their college life.
- **[The 5 Big Benefits of Studying With Friends (Including How It Could Save You Money) | Torrens University](https://www.torrens.edu.au/stories/blog/student-life/the-5-big-benefits-of-studying-with-friends-and-how-it-could-save-you-money):** This article also discusses the many benefits of feeling academically supported by your social circle. It also places a small emphasis on the struggle of first-year students finding friends in their class; a point that lends itself to how joining a community that prioritizes academic growth can be of great help.
- **[How Do I Schedule Classes With Friends? — CGH](https://collegegranthub.com/student-questions/how-do-i-schedule-classes-with-friends/):** There are many considerations to think about when planning what classes to take with your friends. These include the requirements that everyone has in their academic plans, their schedule preferences, and many more. There are many more factors to consider when academically coordinating with others than just classes you want to take together.
- **[Slack Didn’t Break Remote Working, Your Colleagues Did | WIRED](https://www.wired.com/story/slack-remote-working-broken/):** In our current digital world, while the use of messaging services like Slack is great for communicating general ideas or conversations, they can get extremely convoluted very quickly. This can lead to inefficiency in work, disorganization, and ideas getting lost. Thus, this suggests that different needs may sometimes require different platforms so that everything has its own place in an organization’s workflow.
- **[A Systematic Review of the Literature Describing the Outcomes of Near-Peer Mentoring Programs for First Year Medical Students | BMC Medical Education](https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-018-1195-1):** Although more focused on medical students, this paper greatly explores how mentoring—particularly aimed at new students—is of great use for students. Mentoring and coordinating with others on subjects that they are familiar with can offer a helpful perspective that is different from that of professors and TAs.
- **[CourseRoad](https://courseroad.mit.edu/road/$defaultroad$):** An application that is used by MIT students to create long-term graduation plans and schedules. Much like Hydrant, this focuses on more individual planning, but on a long-term scale. However, it is great to keep track of classes you have previously taken and classes that you might be interested in in the future.
- **[MIT OpenGrades](https://opengrades.mit.edu/):** OpenGrades is a tool where students can share their personal experiences that they have had with different classes at MIT. It is great at sharing insights, like what is hard about a class or the time commitment, but does not have any features related to scheduling or organizing academic goals.
- **[Hydrant](https://hydrant.mit.edu/):** Hydrant is a tool used by MIT students to view all the schedule configurations for an individual’s classes that they are taking in a given semester. It has many useful features like class search and a list of class times and locations, but is focused on individual planning rather than group coordination.

# Application Pitch

**Name**  
StudyCircle

**Motivation**  
In academic communities, it is a difficult task to stay academically connected with your peers; knowing who is taking what class, sending a classwide message, and coordinating class-specific schedules are all tasks that require exhausting amounts of organization.

**Key Features**
- **Shared Classees:** Users can see what classes and sections the members of their community are in through both a calendar and list view for ease of navigation. This addresses the problem by having an interactive centralized hub where every member is aware of the academic schedules of others, allowing them to stay academically connected. This feature allows direct stakeholders (like brothers in this context) to be aware of each other’s academic load and work together in shared subjects. Indirect stakeholders (like the Scholarship Chair or professors) reap the benefits of students working together by seeing an increase in academic performance and academic organization.
- Communities
- **Community Poster Board:** Users can make general posts, announcements, or questions to their community. This can be used by all members for community-wide activities, mentorship postings, or events that focus more on academic gatherings. This addresses the problem by providing a fast way to voice and take care of academic and community needs. A feature such as this not only benefits users (such as brothers) by providing an environment to academically interact even if they are not in the same class but also leadership figures in the community (like scholarships) by highlighting gaps in engagement or support.

# User Journey

A user is starting their college semester, and they want to figure out which of the people in their fraternity are taking the same classes as they are so they can set up a study group. The user opens our app on their laptop and sets their schedule by choosing the classes that they are taking this semester. They are able to choose from available classes in the MIT class catalog and select their lecture/recitation/lab sections depending on the class, as well as choose the visibility of their schedule to their community. Once they have set up their schedule, they can go to the “Communities” tab to create their own or join an already-existing community with their fraternity members. After setting up their community, they now have access to their respective course spaces and community board.

After joining a community, the user can see which classes each community member is taking, as well as their schedule (if opted in), so they have an idea of how many people will react to their post if they choose to focus on a specific class. When they go to the “Classes” tab, they can see their own schedule with their own classes in a calendar format, which they can then click to see which members of their community are taking. If they wish to have a more structured list ordered by member, they can go to “Class Member View” and see a list of members who set their visibility as available along with the classes they are taking. With this, they can take the route of creating a group chat directly with members in their community taking their class of interest.

With all the setup complete, the user can now choose how they want to create a study group. Since they wish to send a general posting to their whole fraternity asking who wants to be in a study group, they will navigate to the “Communities” tab, where they can create and view postings by members. Once on that page, they click Make Post,” where they can fill in the “Title” field, the “Body” field, and add a “Looking for Group” tag. With that complete, their posting is viewable by the whole community, and others can reply to the post in order to communicate with the user. Now the user can just wait for other members to reply in order to start their study group!
