# prompt: Look at the guidelines in the testing-concepts file. Generate the test file for the UserEnrollments concept
# response:

Of course. Based on the provided guidelines, the concept specification, and the complete implementation of `UserEnrollmentsConcept.ts`, here is the generated test file.

This test suite is structured to validate the concept's behavior systematically:

1.  **Operational Principle Test**: A comprehensive scenario that walks through the primary use case described in the concept's principle.
2.  **Interesting Scenarios**: Four additional tests that cover edge cases, error conditions, and the full lifecycle of an enrollment (update, remove), ensuring all actions are tested.
3.  **Clear Output**: Includes `console.log` statements to provide a human-readable trace of the test execution, as requested in the guidelines.
