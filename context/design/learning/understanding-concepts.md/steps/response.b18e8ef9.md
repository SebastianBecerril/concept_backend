# response:

Based on the provided text, a "concept" in concept design is a fundamental building block for software development, characterized by:

1. **A Reusable Unit of User-Facing Functionality:** It's designed to provide a specific, intelligible function that users directly interact with or perceive. Examples include *Upvote*, *RestaurantReservation*, *Post*, *Comment*, *Friend*, *UserAuthentication*, etc.

2. **Well-Defined and Intelligible Purpose:** Each concept is closely targeted at delivering a particular function of value within the larger application. Its purpose is clear and understandable to both users and developers.

3. **Self-Contained State:**
   * Each concept maintains its own internal state, which includes objects of various kinds and the relationships between them.
   * This state must be rich enough to support the concept's behavior (e.g., *Upvote* needs user identity to prevent double voting).
   * However, the state should be no richer than necessary (e.g., *Upvote* doesn't need a user's name).
   * Its state is made persistent, typically using a database, as part of a backend service implementation.

4. **Interaction via Atomic Actions:** Concepts interact with users and other concepts through discrete, atomic actions. Some actions are performed by users (e.g., *reserve*, *cancel*), while others are output actions initiated by the concept itself.

5. **Dual Nature (API & Human Protocol):**
   * For developers, a concept's behavior is captured by an API specification, similar to conventional backend services, with functions/endpoints corresponding to its actions.
   * For human users, it represents a familiar behavioral protocol (e.g., the sequence of actions involved in a restaurant reservation).

6. **Archetypal and Reusable:**
   * Concepts are highly reusable across different applications (e.g., the same *Upvote* concept on Stack Overflow and the New York Times).
   * They can also be instantiated multiple times within the same application for different roles.
   * This reusability fosters familiarity for users and allows designers to accumulate and reuse design knowledge.

7. **Mutual Independence (Distinguishing Feature):**
   * This is perhaps its most significant characteristic. Each concept is defined *without reference to any other concepts* and can be understood in isolation.
   * This independence allows for design scalability (different teams can work on them) and promotes true reuse (no forced dependencies).
   * Polymorphism is crucial for this independence, meaning concepts should make minimal assumptions about the content of objects passed as arguments.

8. **Strong Separation of Concerns:**
   * A concept addresses only a single, coherent aspect of functionality, avoiding the conflation of concerns often seen in traditional designs (e.g., a *User* class handling authentication, profiles, and notifications).
   * Instead, these would be separate concepts (*UserAuthentication*, *Profile*, *Notification*).

9. **Completeness of Functionality:**
   * A concept is *complete* with respect to its defined functionality, meaning it does not rely on other concepts to fully execute its core actions. For example, a *Notification* concept would fully handle sending notifications rather than calling an external emailing service.

**How Concepts Work Together (Composition):**
Because concepts are fully independent and cannot directly refer to each other, they are composed using **synchronizations (syncs)**. A sync is a rule that links actions and states across different concepts:

* **`when`**: an action occurs in one concept.
* **`where`**: the state of one or more concepts has a particular property.
* **`then`**: an action happens in another concept (potentially providing input arguments).

**In summary,** concepts are highly modular, independent, user-focused units of functionality that embody a strong separation of concerns, are complete in their purpose, and are designed for maximum reusability and clarity, composed through indirect synchronizations rather than direct dependencies.
