# question: We are brainstorming over my CourseCatalog concept thats in the file with the same name. the assignment 4 file has outdated concepts, but its there to give you context of my application. I am planning to use an API similar to how the MIT student tool Hydrant uses to pull course information. How can this be done? And how do you recommend doing this in the most efficicent and straightfoward way possible?
