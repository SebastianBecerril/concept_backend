### concept CourseCatalog

* **purpose**
  Provide a community-curated and reliable registry of academic terms, courses, and sections, enabling users to easily find and reference shared academic offerings.
* **principle**
  Users contribute academic terms, courses, and sections by providing their details. The catalog intelligently reuses existing entries or creates new ones, thereby building a consistent, shared registry that facilitates academic coordination and connection for the community.
* **state**
  * a set of Terms with
    * a `name` String
    * a `courses` set of Courses
  * a set of Courses with
    * a `term` Term
    * a `courseNumber` String
    * a `courseName` String
    * a `department` String
    * a `sections` set of Sections
  * a set of Sections with
    * a `course` Course
    * a `classType` String
    * a `days` set of Strings
    * a `startTime` DateTime
    * an `endTime` DateTime
    * a `location` String
    * an `instructor` String
* **actions**
  * `createOrGetTerm(name: String): (term: Term)`
    * **requires**
    * **effect** If a `Term` with the exact `name` already exists, returns that `Term`. Otherwise, creates a new `Term` with the given `name` and returns it.
  * `updateTermName(term: Term, newName: String): ()`
    * **requires** `term` exists, and no other `Term` with `newName` exists.
    * **effect** Updates the `name` of `term` to `newName`.
  * `deleteTerm(term: Term): ()`
    * **requires** `term` exists, and no `Course` belongs to `term`.
    * **effect** Removes the `term` from the set.
  * `createOrGetCourse(term: Term, courseNumber: String, courseName: String, department: String): (course: Course)`
    * **requires** `term` exists.
    * **effect** If a `Course` with the exact `courseNumber` in `term` already exists, its `courseName` and `department` are updated to the provided values (to reflect the latest community consensus or input), and the existing `Course` is returned. Otherwise, creates a new `Course` associated with `term` and the provided details, and returns it. The new `Course` is also implicitly added to `term`'s `set of Courses`.
  * `updateCourseDetails(course: Course, newCourseNumber: String, newCourseName: String, newDepartment: String): ()`
    * **requires** `course` exists, and if `newCourseNumber` is different from `course.courseNumber`, then no other `Course` in `course.term` has `newCourseNumber`.
    * **effect** Updates the `courseNumber`, `courseName`, and `department` of `course`.
  * `deleteCourse(course: Course): ()`
    * **requires** `course` exists, and no `Section` belongs to `course`.
    * **effect** Removes the `course` from the set. Also implicitly removes `course` from `course.term`'s `set of Courses`.
  * `createOrGetSection(course: Course, classType: String, days: set of Strings, startTime: DateTime, endTime: DateTime, location: String, instructor: String): (section: Section)`
    * **requires** `course` exists.
    * **effect** If an identical `Section` (matching all provided details) for `course` already exists, returns that `Section`. Otherwise, creates a new `Section` for `course` with the given details and returns it. The new `Section` is also implicitly added to `course`'s `set of Sections`.
  * `updateSectionDetails(section: Section, newClassType: String, newDays: set of Strings, newStartTime: DateTime, newEndTime: DateTime, newLocation: String, newInstructor: String): ()`
    * **requires** `section` exists, and no other `Section` in `section.course` is identical to the section that would result from these updates.
    * **effect** Updates the `classType`, `days`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `location`, and `instructor` of `section`.
  * `deleteSection(section: Section): ()`
    * **requires** `section` exists.
    * **effect** Removes the `section` from the set. Also implicitly removes `section` from `section.course`'s `set of Sections`.

### concept Community \[User]

* **purpose**
  Group users into distinct social or organizational units and manage their membership and roles.
* **principle**
  After a user creates a community, they can invite other users to join as members and assign roles, enabling structured interaction within that unit.
* **state**
  * a set of Communities with
    * a `name` String
    * a `description` String
    * a `creationDate` DateTime
    * a `memberships` set of Memberships
  * a set of Memberships with
    * a `user` User
    * a `community` Community
    * a `role` String
    * a `joinDate` DateTime
* **actions**
  * `createCommunity(name: String, description: String, creator: User): (community: Community)`
    * **requires** `name` is non-empty, a `Community` with `name` does not exist, `creator` exists
    * **effect** creates a new `Community` with the given `name` and `description`, and adds `creator` as an `ADMIN` `Membership` to this `Community`
  * `updateCommunityDetails(community: Community, newName: String, newDescription: String, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `community`
    * **effect** updates the `name` and `description` of `community`
  * `addMember(community: Community, user: User, inviter: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `user` exists, `inviter` exists, `user` is not already a member of `community`, `inviter` is an `ADMIN` member of `community`
    * **effect** creates a `Membership` for `user` in `community` with `MEMBER` role
  * `removeMember(community: Community, user: User, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `user` is a member of `community`, (`requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `community` OR `requester` is `user`)
    * **effect** removes the `Membership` of `user` from `community`
  * `setMemberRole(membership: Membership, newRole: Role, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `membership` exists, `newRole` is valid, `requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `membership.community`, `requester` is not attempting to demote themselves from `ADMIN` to `MEMBER` (unless there is another `ADMIN`)
    * **effect** updates `membership.role` to `newRole`
  * `deleteCommunity(community: Community, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `community`, `community` has no `Memberships` (other than the `requester` if they are the sole admin)
    * **effect** removes `community` and all associated `Memberships`
