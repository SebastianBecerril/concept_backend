# question: We are brainstorming over my user concept (auth plus profile) that are in the top files. the assignment 4 file has outdated concepts (make sure you dont base yourself off these, those were my intial designs), but its there to give you context of my application. The current iteration of my concept are in the top files, can you avluate it and see if it is robust and effective and cohesive with the rest of the app? I am asking you to evaluate them together since I think they play off each other. I also think that the UserProfile concept should also include Courses and Communities, but let me know what you think
