# question: The top six files are my final implementation of all my concepts, and the assignment 4 file is the one that describes my application (the concepts there are just initial designs, disregard and focus on the ones in individual files). Can you evaluate all the concepts and tell me if they are all cohesive and robust and ready to be implemented for my final application?
