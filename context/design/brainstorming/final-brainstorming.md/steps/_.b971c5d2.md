  * `updateSectionDetails(section: Section, newClassType: String, newDays: set of Strings, newStartTime: DateTime, newEndTime: DateTime, newLocation: String, newInstructor: String): ()`
    * **requires** `section` exists, and no other `Section` in `section.course` is identical to the section that would result from these updates.
