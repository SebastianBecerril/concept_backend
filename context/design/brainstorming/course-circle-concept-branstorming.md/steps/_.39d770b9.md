# Concept Design

## Concept Specifications

### concept CourseCatalog

  * **deleteCourse(course: Course): ()**
    * **requires** course exists
    * **effect** removes the course from the set
  * **deleteSection(section: Section): ()**
    * **requires** section exists

### concept UserEnrollments \[User, Course, Section]

* **purpose**\
  keep a record of which users are enrolled in which courses and sections
* **principle**\
  after a user adds an enrollment, the scheduler shows the classes and sections a user is a part of
* **state**
  * a set of Enrollments with
    * an owner User
    * a course Course
    * a section Section
    * a visibility flag
* **actions**
  * **addEnrollment(owner: User, course: Course, section: Section, visibility: flag): ()**
    * **requires** user, course, and section exist; owner is not already part of the course
    * **effect** creates an enrollment for owner in course with section
  * **updateEnrollmentSection(owner: User, course: Course, section: Section): ()**
    * **requires** user, course, and section exist; owner is not already part of the course
    * **effect** updates the enrollment
  * **setEnrollmentVisibility(owner: User, course: Course, visibility: flag): ()**
    * **requires** user, course, and section exist
    * **effect** updates the visibility flag for that enrollment
  * **removeEnrollment(enrollment: Enrollment): ()**
    * **requires** enrollment exists
    * **effect** deletes the enrollment

***

### concept CourseSpace \[Course, User]

* **purpose**\
  provide a course hub for shared posts
* **principle**\
  after a space is created for a course, members can add posts tied to that course for ease of access to information
* **state**
  * a set of Spaces with
    * a members set of Users
    * a course Course
    * a name String
    * a description String
    * a set of Posts
  * a set of Posts with
    * an author User
    * a title String
    * a body String
* **actions**
  * **createSpace(course: Course, name: String, description: String): (space: Space)**
    * **requires** course exists
    * **effect** creates a new space bound to course with given name and description
  * **addMember(space: Space, user: User): ()**
    * **requires** space exists, user exists, and user not already in space members
    * **effect** adds user to the space’s members
  * **removeMember(space: Space, user: User): ()**
    * **requires** space exists and user is in space members
    * **effect** removes user from the space’s members
  * **postToSpace(space: Space, author: User, title: String, body: String): (post: Post)**
    * **requires** space exists, author exists, author is in space members, and body is non-empty
    * **effect** creates a new post in the space authored by author with the given body
  * **deletePost(space: Space, post: Post): ()**
    * **requires** space exists, post exists in space
    * **effect** removes the post from the space

***

### concept CommunityBoard \[User, Course]

* **purpose**\
  host community-wide posts with the purpose of academically connecting members on all sorts of matters
* **principle**\
  after a user creates a tagged posting, others can reply
* **state**
  * a set of Postings with
    * an author User
    * a title String
    * a body String
    * a tags set of Strings
    * an optional course Course
    * a set of Replies
  * a set of Replies with

    * a body String
* **actions**
  * **createPost(author: User, title: String, body: String, tags: set of Strings, course: Course): (posting: Posting)**

## Syncs

* **sync enrollGrantsSpaceMembership**
  * **when** UserEnrollments.addEnrollment(owner, course, section, visibility)
  * **then** CourseSpace.addMember(space, owner)

* **sync unenrollRemovesSpaceMembership**
  * **when** UserEnrollments.removeEnrollment(enrollment)
  * **then** CourseSpace.removeMember(space, enrollment.owner)

* **sync createSpaceOnFirstEnrollment**
  * **when** UserEnrollments.addEnrollment(owner, course, section, visibility)
  * **where** no CourseSpace space exists for course
  * **then** CourseSpace.createSpace(course, name, description)

## Notes

I have chosen four main concepts that compose the primary functionality of my app. The CourseCatalog concept serves mostly as a foundation concept that will allow users to choose their classes for their schedule and class list from the most up-to-date MIT course catalog. The UserEnrollments concept serves as the foundation for the feature of users sharing with each other which classes they are in, along with which section and other class details. The CourseSpace concept revolves around the course spaces feature, which serves as a hub for each class that has members of a community in it for them to post class-specific content. Finally, the CommunityBoard concept is a pretty straightforward one, as it just handles the Community Poster Board feature that allows members of a community to start community-wide threads and discussions related to academic matters. Also, I am about to submit this and I run out of time, but there is also supposed to be a community concept that keeps track of a community's members. Therefore, just wanted to calrify I do acknowledge it is needed, I just don't have time to write it out. I apologize about that.
