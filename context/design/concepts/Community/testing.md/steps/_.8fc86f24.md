# Test implementation

While testing, use the `testDb` function, which returns a tuple of the database and client so that you can close it.

```typescript
import { testDb } from "@utils/database.ts";

Deno.test("...", async () => {
  const [db, client] = await testDb();

  // ... tests

  await client.close();
});
```

The database is already automatically dropped before every test file using the `Deno.test.beforeAll` hook: do not include any additional manipulation of the database for this purpose.

Use the Deno.test framework, splitting by appropriate test steps and describing each behavior. Import helpers from:

```typescript
import { assertEquals } from "jsr:@std/assert"; // or any other utility from the library
```

### concept Community \[User]

* **purpose**
  Group users into distinct social or organizational units and manage their membership and roles.
* **principle**
  After a user creates a community, they can invite other users to join as members and assign roles, enabling structured interaction within that unit.
* **state**
  * a set of Communities with
    * a `name` String
    * a `description` String
    * a `creationDate` DateTime
    * a `memberships` set of Memberships
  * a set of Memberships with
    * a `user` User
    * a `community` Community
    * a `role` String
    * a `joinDate` DateTime
* **actions**
  * `createCommunity(name: String, description: String, creator: User): (community: Community)`
    * **requires** `name` and `description` are non-empty, a `Community` with `name` does not exist, `creator` exists
    * **effect** creates a new `Community` with the given `name` and `description`, and adds `creator` as an `ADMIN` `Membership` to this `Community`
  * `updateCommunityDetails(community: Community, newName: String, newDescription: String, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `community`
    * **effect** updates the `name` and `description` of `community`
  * `addMember(community: Community, user: User, inviter: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `user` exists, `inviter` exists, `user` is not already a member of `community`, `inviter` is an `ADMIN` member of `community`
    * **effect** creates a `Membership` for `user` in `community` with `MEMBER` role
  * `removeMember(community: Community, user: User, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `user` is a member of `community`, (`requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `community` OR `requester` is `user`)
    * **effect** removes the `Membership` of `user` from `community`
  * `setMemberRole(membership: Membership, newRole: String, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `membership` exists, `newRole` is valid, `requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `membership.community`, `requester` is not attempting to demote themselves from `ADMIN` to `MEMBER` (unless there is another `ADMIN`)
    * **effect** updates `membership.role` to `newRole`
  * `deleteCommunity(community: Community, requester: User): ()`
    * **requires** `community` exists, `requester` is an `ADMIN` member of `community`
    * **effect** removes `community` and all associated `Memberships`
