# trace:

This trace describes the sequence of actions that fulfills the concept's principle: "After a user registers with unique credentials, they can log in to prove their identity, establishing an authenticated session for further interactions."

1. **Action**: `UserAuthentication.register({ username: "alice", password: "password123" })`
   * **Requires**: The username "alice" does not exist in the state, and "password123" meets the strength requirements.
   * **Effect**: A new `User` is created and stored. The state now contains a user record for "alice".
   * **Return**: `{ user: "user-id-alice" }`

2. **Action**: `UserAuthentication.login({ username: "alice", password: "password123" })`
   * **Requires**: A user with the username "alice" and the corresponding password exists in the state. This requirement is met by the previous action.
   * **Effect**: A new `ActiveSession` is created and stored, linking "user-id-alice" to a new, unique session ID. The session is given an expiration time in the future.
   * **Return**: `{ user: "user-id-alice", sessionId: "session-id-123" }`

3. **Interaction**: The application now holds "session-id-123", which represents an authenticated session for the user "alice". It can use this session ID in subsequent interactions with other concepts. To verify its validity, a query can be performed:
   * **Query**: `UserAuthentication._isValidSession({ sessionId: "session-id-123" })`
   * **Effect**: The state is read. The query finds the active session and confirms its expiration time has not passed.
   * **Return**: `{ user: "user-id-alice" }`

This sequence successfully demonstrates the core purpose of the concept: creating a user identity and then establishing a verifiable, temporary session to represent that identity.
