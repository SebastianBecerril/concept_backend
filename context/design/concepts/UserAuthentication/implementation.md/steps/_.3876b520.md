# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

### concept UserAuthentication

* **purpose**
  Identify users and manage their access credentials.
* **principle**
  After a user registers with unique credentials, they can log in to prove their identity, establishing an authenticated session for further interactions.
* **state**
  * a set of Users with
    * a `username` String
    * a `password` String
    * a `registrationDate` DateTime
  * a set of ActiveSessions with
    * a `user` User
    * a `sessionId` String
    * a `creationTime` DateTime
    * an `expiryTime` DateTime
* **actions**
  * `register(username: String, password: String): (user: User)`
    * **requires** `username` is unique, `password` meets strength requirements
    * **effect** creates a new `User` with the given `username` and a  `password`
  * l`ogin(username: String, password: String): (user: User, sessionId: String)`
    * **requires** `username` and `password` match an existing `User`
    * **effect** creates a new `ActiveSession` for the matched `User` with a unique `sessionId` and `expiryTime`, returning the `User` and `sessionId`
  * `logout(sessionId: String): ()`
    * **requires** `sessionId` matches an existing `ActiveSession`
    * **effect** removes the `ActiveSession`
  * `system invalidateExpiredSessions(): ()`
    * **requires** an `ActiveSession` exists where `currentTime` is after `expiryTime`
    * **effect** removes all `ActiveSessions` where `currentTime` is after `expiryTime`
