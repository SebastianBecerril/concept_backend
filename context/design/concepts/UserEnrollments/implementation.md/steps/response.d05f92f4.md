# response:

Of course. Based on the concept's purpose to "declare and manage" enrollments and "control its visibility," I will generate the remaining actions and queries.

The generated code completes the concept by adding:

* **Actions** to `removeEnrollment` and `updateVisibility`, fulfilling the "manage" and "control" parts of the purpose.
* **Queries** to retrieve enrollments by ID, by user, and by course (respecting visibility), which makes the concept's state observable and useful, directly supporting the "can be viewed" part of the principle.

This implementation follows all the established guidelines, including robust error handling, clear JSDoc, and adherence to the specified method signatures.

Here is the complete `UserEnrollmentsConcept.ts` file with the new methods.
