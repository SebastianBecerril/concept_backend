# Guidelines

**Testing concepts**. Your tests should cover the basic behavior of the concept but should also include some more interesting cases. Your tests should use the Deno testing framework and should be programmatic (that is, determining in the code whether they succeeded or failed, and not requiring a human to interpret console messages). They should also print helpful messages to the console with action inputs and outputs so that a human reader can make sense of the test execution when it runs in the console. Some more details about the test cases you should include:

* **Operational principle**. A sequence of action executions that corresponds to the operational principle, representing the common expected usage of the concept. These sequence is not required to use all the actions; operational principles often do not include a deletion action, for example.
* **Interesting scenarios**. Sequences of action executions that correspond to less common cases: probing interesting corners of the functionality, undoing actions with deletions and cancellations, repeating actions with the same arguments, etc. In some of these scenarios actions may be expected to throw errors.
* **Number required**. For each concept, you should have one test sequence for the operational principle, and 3-5 additional interesting scenarios. Every action should be executed successfully in at least one of the scenarios.
* **No state setup**. Your test cases should not require any setting up of the concept state except by calling concept actions. When you are testing one action at a time, this means that you will want to order your actions carefully (for example, by the operational principle) to avoid having to set up state.
* **Saving test execution output**. Save the test execution output by copy-pasting from the console to a markdown file.

### concept CourseCatalog

* **purpose**
  Provide a community-curated and reliable registry of academic terms, courses, and sections, enabling users to easily find and reference shared academic offerings.
* **principle**
  Users contribute academic terms, courses, and sections by providing their details. The catalog intelligently reuses existing entries or creates new ones, thereby building a consistent, shared registry that facilitates academic coordination and connection for the community.
* **state**
  * a set of Terms with
    * a `name` String
  * a set of Courses with
    * a `term` Term
    * a `courseNumber` String
    * a `courseName` String
    * a `department` String
  * a set of Sections with
    * a `course` Course
    * a `classType` String
    * a `days` set of Strings
    * a `startTime` DateTime
    * an `endTime` DateTime
    * a `location` String
    * an `instructor` String
* **actions**
  * `createOrGetTerm(name: String): (term: Term)`
    * **requires**
    * **effect** If a `Term` with the exact `name` already exists, returns that `Term`. Otherwise, creates a new `Term` with the given `name` and returns it.
  * `updateTermName(term: Term, newName: String): ()`
    * **requires** `term` exists, and no other `Term` with `newName` exists.
    * **effect** Updates the `name` of `term` to `newName`.
  * `deleteTerm(term: Term): ()`
    * **requires** `term` exists, and no `Course` belongs to `term`.
    * **effect** Removes the `term` from the set.
  * `createOrGetCourse(term: Term, courseNumber: String, courseName: String, department: String): (course: Course)`
    * **requires** `term` exists.
    * **effect** If a `Course` with the exact `courseNumber` in `term` already exists, its `courseName` and `department` are updated to the provided values (to reflect the latest community consensus or input), and the existing `Course` is returned. Otherwise, creates a new `Course` associated with `term` and the provided details, and returns it.
  * `updateCourseDetails(course: Course, newCourseNumber: String, newCourseName: String, newDepartment: String): ()`
    * **requires** `course` exists, and if `newCourseNumber` is different from `course.courseNumber`, then no other `Course` in `course.term` has `newCourseNumber`.
    * **effect** Updates the `courseNumber`, `courseName`, and `department` of `course`.
  * `deleteCourse(course: Course): ()`
    * **requires** `course` exists, and no `Section` belongs to `course`.
    * **effect** Removes the `course` from the set.
  * `createOrGetSection(course: Course, classType: String, days: set of Strings, startTime: DateTime, endTime: DateTime, location: String, instructor: String): (section: Section)`
    * **requires** `course` exists.
    * **effect** If an identical `Section` (matching all provided details) for `course` already exists, returns that `Section`. Otherwise, creates a new `Section` for `course` with the given details and returns it.
  * `updateSectionDetails(section: Section, newClassType: String, newDays: set of Strings, newStartTime: DateTime, newEndTime: DateTime, newLocation: String, newInstructor: String): ()`
    * **requires** `section` exists, and no other `Section` in `section.course` is identical to the section that would result from these updates.
    * **effect** Updates the `classType`, `days`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `location`, and `instructor` of `section`.
  * `deleteSection(section: Section): ()`
    * **requires** `section` exists.
    * **effect** Removes the `section` from the set.
