# trace:

The trace for the operational principle test demonstrates how the `CourseCatalog` concept fulfills its purpose of building a shared, de-duplicated registry of academic offerings.

1. **Action: `createOrGetTerm({ name: "Fall 2024" })`**
   * **Effect:** A new `Term` for "Fall 2024" does not exist, so it is created. The system returns the unique ID for this new term (e.g., `termId1`). The state now contains one term.

2. **Action: `createOrGetCourse({ term: termId1, courseNumber: "6.1040", ... })`**
   * **Effect:** A new `Course` for "6.1040" within the "Fall 2024" term does not exist, so it is created. The system returns its unique ID (`courseId1`). The state now contains one course linked to the term.

3. **Action: `createOrGetSection({ course: courseId1, classType: "Lecture", ... })`**
   * **Effect:** A new `Section` for the "6.1040" course does not exist, so it is created. The system returns its unique ID (`sectionId1`). The state now contains one section linked to the course.

4. **Action: `createOrGetTerm({ name: "Fall 2024" })` (Second Call)**
   * **Effect:** The concept checks its state and finds that a `Term` with the name "Fall 2024" already exists. Instead of creating a new one, it **reuses the existing entry** and returns the original ID (`termId1`). This demonstrates the core "get" part of the pattern and prevents duplicates.

5. **Action: `createOrGetCourse({ term: termId1, courseNumber: "6.1040", ... })` (Second Call)**
   * **Effect:** The concept finds an existing `Course` with the number "6.1040" in term `termId1`. It reuses this entry and returns the original ID (`courseId1`). The community-curation aspect is also demonstrated as the `courseName` and `department` are updated to the latest provided values.

6. **Action: `createOrGetSection({ course: courseId1, classType: "Lecture", ... })` (Second Call)**
   * **Effect:** The concept finds an identical `Section` for course `courseId1` matching all details. It reuses this entry and returns the original ID (`sectionId1`).

The trace successfully confirms that the concept intelligently reuses existing entries, fulfilling its principle of building a consistent, shared registry.
