# response:

Of course. You are absolutely right to implement the queries before testing, as your tests will need them to verify the state of the concept after performing actions.

Based on the structure of your concept, a user will need two primary types of queries:

1. **Get-by-Parent:** To navigate the hierarchy (e.g., find all courses for a term).
2. **Get-by-ID:** To fetch the specific details of a single entity when its ID is known.

Here is the complete set of query methods you should add to your `CourseCatalogConcept.ts` file. I've included detailed documentation and sensible default sorting to make them as useful as possible.

You can paste this entire block of code at the end of your `CourseCatalogConcept` class, right after the last action method (`deleteSection`).

```typescript
  // =================================================================================================
  //                                          QUERIES
  // =================================================================================================

  /**
   * @query Retrieves all terms from the catalog.
   * @returns {Promise<TermSchema[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of all terms, sorted alphabetically by name.
   */
  async _getTerms(): Promise<TermSchema[]> {
    return this.terms.find().sort({ name: 1 }).toArray();
  }

  /**
   * @query Retrieves a single term by its unique ID.
   * @param {ID} term - The ID of the term to retrieve.
   * @returns {Promise<TermSchema | null>} A promise that resolves to the term document or null if not found.
   */
  async _getTermById({ term }: { term: ID }): Promise<TermSchema | null> {
    return this.terms.findOne({ _id: term });
  }

  /**
   * @query Retrieves all courses associated with a specific term.
   * @param {ID} term - The ID of the term for which to retrieve courses.
   * @returns {Promise<CourseSchema[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of courses for the given term, sorted by course number.
   */
  async _getCoursesForTerm({ term }: { term: ID }): Promise<CourseSchema[]> {
    if (!term) {
      return [];
    }
    return this.courses.find({ term }).sort({ courseNumber: 1 }).toArray();
  }

  /**
   * @query Retrieves a single course by its unique ID.
   * @param {ID} course - The ID of the course to retrieve.
   * @returns {Promise<CourseSchema | null>} A promise that resolves to the course document or null if not found.
   */
  async _getCourseById({ course }: { course: ID }): Promise<CourseSchema | null> {
    return this.courses.findOne({ _id: course });
  }

  /**
   * @query Retrieves all sections associated with a specific course.
   * @param {ID} course - The ID of the course for which to retrieve sections.
   * @returns {Promise<SectionSchema[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of sections for the given course, sorted by class type and then start time.
   */
  async _getSectionsForCourse({ course }: { course: ID }): Promise<SectionSchema[]> {
    if (!course) {
      return [];
    }
    return this.sections.find({ course }).sort({ classType: 1, startTime: 1 }).toArray();
  }

  /**
   * @query Retrieves a single section by its unique ID.
   * @param {ID} section - The ID of the section to retrieve.
   * @returns {Promise<SectionSchema | null>} A promise that resolves to the section document or null if not found.
   */
  async _getSectionById({ section }: { section: ID }): Promise<SectionSchema | null> {
    return this.sections.findOne({ _id: section });
  }
}

### Why This Set of Queries is Correct

1. **Completeness:** This set provides all the fundamental read operations needed to interact with the catalog's data. You can list top-level items, traverse the hierarchy, and look up any specific item by its reference.
2. **Adherence to Convention:** All methods are correctly prefixed with an underscore (`_`) as required by the Concept Design documentation for queries.
3. **Robustness:** The "Get-by-Parent" queries include guard clauses (`if (!term)`) to gracefully handle null inputs, preventing unnecessary database calls or errors.
4. **Usability:** Adding default `sort()` operations makes the query results predictable and immediately useful for display in a user interface without requiring extra client-side sorting.
5. **Efficiency:** These queries map directly to simple, indexed `find` and `findOne` operations in MongoDB, ensuring they will be highly performant.

Your concept is now fully implemented with a complete API for both writing (actions) and reading (queries). **You are officially ready to move on to testing.**
